1. For a graph with n nodes, the number of edges in a complete graph is n * (n - 1) / 2.

2. The minimum number of edges to make a graph on n nodes is 0.

3. The minimum number of edges to make a connected graph of n nodes is n - 1.

4. Insertion and deletion of edges is fastest in an adjacency list.

5. An adjacency list should be used for a graph with a large number of nodes (>10^8) but with a few edges between them.

6. Yes, adjacencyMatrix[i][j] != adjacencyMatrix[j][i] in a directed graph.

7. For a graph with n nodes, the number of edges in a complete graph is n * (n - 1) / 2.

8. The minimum number of edges to make a graph on n nodes is 0.

11. The indegree of vertex 3 is 1.

12. Edge List representation: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1)].

13. The maximum number of edges in a simple undirected graph with n nodes is n * (n - 1) / 2.

14. The minimum number of edges in a simple undirected connected graph with n nodes is n - 1.

15. The minimum number of colors needed to color the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color is the chromatic number of the graph.

16. The minimum cut of a graph is the smallest number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.

17. The minimum number of nodes required to create a cycle in a directed graph is 3.

18. The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges connected to it.

19. The degree of vertex C is 2.

20. The time complexity of finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Prim's algorithm is O(E + V log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

21. In a complete graph, the sum of the degrees of all the vertices is n * (n - 1), where n is the number of vertices.

22. No, a graph with 10 vertices and 25 edges is not a tree because a tree with 10 vertices must have exactly 9 edges.
