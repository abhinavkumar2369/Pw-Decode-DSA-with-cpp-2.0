## Questions üìù


1. There is a group of n people labeled from 0 to n - 1 where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.

You are given an array richer where richer[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that ai has more money than bi and an integer array quiet where quiet[i] is the quietness of the ith person. All the given data in richer are logically correct (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where x is
richer than y and y is richer than x at the same time).

Return an integer array answer where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person x.



2. `https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/`
There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in
ascending order.



3. You are in a city that consists of n intersections numbered from 0 to n - 1 with bi-directional roads between some intersections. The inputs are generated such that you can reach any intersection from any other intersection and that there is at most one road between any two intersections.

You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ui, vi, timei] means that there is a road between intersections ui and vi that takes timei minutes to travel. You want to know in how many ways you can travel from intersection 0 to intersection n - 1 in the shortest amount of time.

Return the number of ways you can arrive at your destination in the shortest amount of time. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.



4.There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses -1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course ai first if you want to take course bi.

Prerequisites can also be indirect. If course a is a prerequisite of course b, and course b is a prerequisite of course c, then course a is a prerequisite of course c.

You are also given an array queries where queries[j] = [uj, vj]. For the jth query, you should answer whether course uj is a prerequisite of course vj or not.

Return a boolean array answer, where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.




5. You are given a network of n nodes, labeled from 1 to n. You are also given times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (ui, vi, wi), where ui is the source node, vi is the target node, and wi is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node k. Return the minimum time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the n nodes to receive the signal, return -1.
