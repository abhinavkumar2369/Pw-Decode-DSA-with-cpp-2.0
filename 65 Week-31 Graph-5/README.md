1. There are n computers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by ethernet cables connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between computers ai and bi. Any computer can reach any other computer directly or indirectly through the network.

You are given initial computer network connections. You can extract certain cables between two directly connected computers, and place them between any pair of disconnected computers to make them directly connected.

Return the minimum number of times you need to do this in order to make all the computers connected. If it is not possible, return -1.




2. On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.
