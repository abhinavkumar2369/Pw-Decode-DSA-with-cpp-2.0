## Questions 📝

1. Write a program to store 10 at every index of a 2D matrix with 5 rows and 5 columns.


2. Write a program to add two matrices and save the result in one of the given matrices.

    Input:
    ```sh
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

    4 5 8
    0 0 8
    1 2 0
    ```
    
    Output:
    ```sh
    5 7 11
    4 5 14
    8 10 9
    ```

    
3. Given a matrix ‘A’ of dimension n x m and 2 coordinates (l1, r1) and (l2, r2). Return the sum of the rectangle from (l1,r1) to (l2, r2).

    Input 1:
    ```sh
    1 2 -3 4
    0 0 -4 2
    1 -1 2 3
    -4 -5 -7 0
    l1 = 1, r1 = 2 , l2 = 3 , r2 = 3
    ```
    Output 1: -4

    Input 2:
    ```sh
    1 2 -3 4
    0 0 -4 2
    1 -1 2 3
    -4 -5 -7 0
    l1 = 1, r1 = 0 , l2 = 0 , r2 = 3
    ```
    Output 1: 2

   
4. Write a C++ program to find the largest element of a given 2D array of integers.

   Input:
    ```sh
    1 3 4 6
    2 4 5 7
    3 5 6 8
    4 6 7 9
    ```
    Output: 9

   
5. Write a program to print the row number having the maximum sum in a given matrix.

   Input:
   ```sh
   1 3 5 7
   3 4 7 8
   1 4 12 3
   ```
   Output: 2
   
   > Explanation : The 2nd row has the maximum sum i.e. `1+4+12+3 = 20`

   
6. Write a function which accepts a 2D array of integers and its size as arguments and displays the elements of middle row and the elements of middle column.
   (Assuming the 2D Array to be a square matrix with odd dimensions i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 etc...)

    Input:
    ```sh
    1 2 3 4 5
    3 4 5 6 7
    7 6 5 4 3
    8 7 6 5 4
    1 2 37 8 0
    ```
    
    Output:
    ```sh
        3
        5
    7 6 5 4 3
        6
        37
    ```
