1. Write a program to find the minimum element of an array using recursion.
2. Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array using recursion.
3. Write a program to find the index of a given element in an array using recursion. If the element is present, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

4. Print all the elements of an array in reverse order using recursion.

5. Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set). 
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.
    
    Example 1: 
    Input: nums = [1,2,2] 
    Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
