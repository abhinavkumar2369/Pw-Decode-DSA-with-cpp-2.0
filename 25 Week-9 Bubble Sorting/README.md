## Questions üìù

1. Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
    - It is stable sort
    - It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
    - It involves swapping of adjacent elements
    - After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.


2. What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
    - [1,3,2,4,5,6]
    - [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    - [1,2,5,4,3,6]
    - [1,2,4,5,3,6]


3. In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:
    - When the array is sorted in increasing order
    - When the array is sorted partially
    - When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
    - When the array is nearly sorted.


4. Sort the array in descending order using Bubble Sort.


5. Check if the given array is almost sorted. (elements are at-most one position away)
