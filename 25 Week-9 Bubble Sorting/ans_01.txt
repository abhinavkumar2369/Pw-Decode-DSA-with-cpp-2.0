1.  It is a stable sort:
    - True.
    - Bubble sort is stable because it does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys.


2.  It has a worst-case space complexity of O(n):
    - False
    - Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm and has a worst-case space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of additional space.


3.  It involves swapping of adjacent elements:
    - True
    - Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.


4.  After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.
    - True
    - In each pass through the array, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end.
